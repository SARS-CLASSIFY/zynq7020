TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -11.483 ns between top_i/pin_ctrl_0/inst/pin_ctrl_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/u_pin_ctrl_sub/fre_status_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and top_i/pin_ctrl_0/inst/pin_ctrl_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/u_pin_ctrl_sub/cnt_max_reg[12]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0).
